With $8 Million in Recent Funding, Nebula Graph Emerges as Ideal for CIOs, Data Architects and Data Scientists in AI, Finance, Government, Healthcare, IoT, and More

HANGZHOU, China – June  29, 2020 – Nebula Graph™ is now commercially available as the only database that can store and process billions of data points with trillions of relational connections in a shared-nothing distributed architecture for the industry’s best business continuity. This makes it the highest performing graph database in the world. It is designed to meet the biggest data information discovery needs of the world’s largest businesses.

Earlier this month Nebula Graph raised $8M in a series pre-A funding round. The lead investor was Redpoint China Ventures. Matrix Partners China, who previously contributed as an angel investor, also contributed to this series pre-A round.

Nebula Graph is an open-source graph database. It was developed by VEsoft Inc. engineers. The team collectively has many years of leadership experience at some of the world’s most recognizable technology companies, such as Alibaba, Facebook, Huawei, and IBM.

## Nebula Graph Advantages
Nebula Graph adopted an open source distributed architecture. This is a strength allowing it to securely process data sets with more capable performance compared to  any competing graph database. This makes it the most capable big data analytics database in the world.

Nebula Graph’s distributed high-availability architecture is also designed for scalability and recovery without disruption, ensuring the best business continuity. This deployment model and architecture make it the most reliable graph database in the world.

In addition, Nebula Graph created its nGQL programmable query language. It is very much like the common SQL query language but designed for graphs. So, this helps ensure there is little learning curve to get started. Nebula Graph is also provided with Nebula Graph Studio, a visualization application that combines data imports with graph exploration. This delivers a better understanding of data over textual formats.

## The Graph Database Market and Applications
Graph databases are disrupting the billion-dollar market for the traditional Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). This is because large organizations today require big data and business analytics exceeding RDBMS capabilities. Nebula Graph has been launched for this purpose.

Graph databases are different from RDBMS databases because they store deep relationship characteristics about data within data itself. A graph database can efficiently manage millions of transactions or more and uncover how data sets relate to each other.

Nebula Graph is ideal for a CIO seeking to uncover the value of connected business data. Data Architects are another ideal user, who typically look to process connected data cost-effectively. Finally, Data Scientists will find it useful to explore the value buried in connected data.

## Nebula Graph Real-World Usage
There are many markets that have large amounts of meaningless information stored in separate silos, ideal for Nebula Graph to mine it for meaningful results. This is true from finance, healthcare, and government agencies to Internet-of-Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and more. Because of Nebula Graph’s proven capabilities, some of the world’s leading Internet properties are already using it in their real-world applications.

Xiaohongshu, a large user-generated-content community (UGC community) in Asia has countless relationships on the platform, from followers to likes. They use Nebula Graph for anti-fraud in their marketing. It prevents fraudulent users from stealing coupons to resell them. They also use it to detect bots and bot content.  Youzan is a popular Asia-based ecommerce platform selling a variety of products. They are using Nebula Graph as a real time product recommendation engine. Finally, Qichacha is a popular business information inquiry platform. The company is using Nebula Graph to discover insider trading transactions.      
## Nebula Graph Pricing and Availability
Nebula Graph has been beta mode. Nebula Graph v1.0 is now commercially proven and immediately available under Apache 2.0 licensing in the open source community. Plans are that, at some point, it will also be made available as a cloud service. It is currently available to businesses in North America, Europe, and Asia.

**Qian Yong, Graph Tech team leader at [JD Digits](https://corporate.jd.com/home) (NASDAQ:JD)**

“JDD used to use Janus Graph as its graph platform. The main problem with Janus Graph was slow read and write capability as well as an inactive community. The bug fixes were slow to come and the experience was not good. Then we encountered Nebula Graph when looking for new graph database solutions. JDD immediately joined the community and partnered with the Nebula Graph team. We have worked together and developed many features. With the highly performant distributed storage and query capabilities of Nebula Graph, JDD is able to dig up the most important connections from our super large amounts of business data, which benefits both internal and external businesses. We have been migrating our graph related projects from Janus Graph to Nebula Graph.”

**Zhao Dengchang, the AI platform expert at [Meituan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meituan-Dianping) (3690.HK)**

"Before we found Nebula Graph, we had tried many well-ranking graph databases on db-engines.com, including Neo4j, Janus Graph, and Dgraph. However, our project was not able to go live because these solutions couldn’t meet our requirements from both a scalability and performance point of view. Then we found that Nebula Graph is neatly designed and scalable. In addition, it is written in C++ and highly performant. Nebula Graph is built distributed. Also, the team is excellent and capable. We have worked with them and solved so many problems and finally improved the performance much higher than we had expected. We have set up a graph platform based on our existing infrastructure for easier business access. Currently we are working closely together, hoping to migrate more knowledge graph projects to Nebula Graph."

**Chen Qi, the Data Platform expert at [YouZan](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/youzan) (8083.HK)**

"There are tremendous advantages in graph-based risk management and recommendation solutions compared to traditional ones. Thanks to the innovative capabilities enabled by the graph technology, we have found a bunch of new growing opportunities. Therefore, we have been looking for highly performant open source graph databases based on our requirements of high throughput and low latency. After a thorough comparison among multiple solutions including Nebula Graph, Neo4j, Dgraph, and JanusGraph, we finally chose Nebula Graph because first, the scalable distributed architecture can avoid capacity bottlenecks for business growth. Second,  the performance of Nebula Graph meets our expectations better than the other candidates. And third, the community is quite active and responsive when we have encountered any problems."

**Zheng Wenyu, the Knowledge Graph Algorithm expert at Suzhou Langdong Network Technology Co., Ltd (**[**Qichacha**](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/qichacha)**)**

"The graph database technology is perfect as the infrastructure for the typical knowledge graph scenarios like enterprise graph, supply chain, and enterprise knowledge graph based on the relationships among enterprises. At the very beginning, we adopted a well-known single-host graph database which did support  our rapid business growth in our early stage. However, our business data scaled rapidly and the original solution fell short in both scalability and timeliness. We have been keeping a close eye on Nebula Graph ever since its beta launch back in May 2019 and found that the distributed architecture meets our business requirements perfectly. Plus the project has iterated fast. After a few months of trial and profiling, Nebula Graph has substituted the original solution in most of our internal business units. We plan to migrate more businesses to Nebula Graph in the future as soon as the OpenCypher compatibility is ready."

**Chuixue, head of the anti-cheat and risk control algorithm at [xiaohongshu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaohongshu) (RED)**

"I have a graph, a red graph. There are a lot of graphs that exist in xiaohongshu as an online community. They decipher the connections between users and notes, followings among users, transaction relationships, etc. A traditional RDBMS cannot efficiently support the graph storage and online queries at xiaohongshu. I have done my research on many graph databases out there on the market. Some just hope for Moore's law and some just cannot meet our performance requirements. The reasons we chose Nebula Graph include that we believe that the Nebula Graph team has the deepest understanding of the graph database industry because they have tremendous experience in real-time recommendations, search, and risk control. In addition, the core architecture provides cluster-level scalability and supports super-scale datasets perfectly. It's worth mentioning that Nebula Graph has realized Reservoir Sampling to solve the super nodes problem in the graph world per xiaohongshu's request. We are protecting the Red Graph community with Nebula Graph, the underlying risk control weapon. Meanwhile we are adopting Nebula Graph in other business units."
