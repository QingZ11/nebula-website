## Nebula Graph Set to Disrupt Big Data Market with Highest Performing Graph Database

HANGZHOU, China – June 15, 2020 – VEsoft Inc., the developer of the Nebula Graph™ database, today announced it raised $8M in a series pre-A funding round. The lead investor is Redpoint China Ventures. Matrix Partners China, who previously contributed as an angel investor, also contributed to this series pre-A round. The funding will be used for additional product development and to bring Nebula Graph to market in North America, Europe, and Asia.

Nebula Graph will soon be offered as a cloud service. The graph database was developed to disrupt the big data market by providing an ability to meet the biggest data information discovery needs of the world’s largest organizations. At launch, Nebula Graph will empower users to store and process billions of data points with trillions of relational connections.

“There are many business and societal possibilities behind big data that remain untapped, trapped behind limitations of existing database capabilities,” said Sherman Ye, CEO and founder of VEsoft, Inc. “The idea behind Nebula Graph is to unleash that hidden intelligence and we’re excited that Redpoint Ventures and Matrix Partners are aligned with us to do so.”

## About the Database Market

Graph databases are disrupting the near $50 billion market for the traditional Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). This is because large organizations today require big data and business analytics exceeding RDBMS capabilities.

Funding for graph databases like Nebula Graph has been strong. In the last two years alone, more than $130 million has been pumped into four competing graph databases. Graph databases are different from RDBMS databases because they store deep relationship characteristics about data within data itself. A graph database is capable of efficiently managing millions of transactions or more to uncover how data sets relate to each other. They essentially remove the six degrees of separation that exists within scattered data to uncover intelligence hidden within.

“With a rapid growth of informatization, massive data has generated large-scale relationship networks,” said David Yuan, founding and managing partner, Redpoint China Ventures. “Gartner indicated that the global graph database market will grow to nearly $10 billion at a CAGR of 100 percent in the next two to three years. This provides a huge opportunity for start-ups. Since its establishment and open-source availability in May 2019, the Nebula Graph team has demonstrated strong abilities, including in-depth industrial understanding and experience in product development. The team released its first beta version of the database product in June 2019, which has been quickly accepted and recognized by some leading Internet platforms. We have great confidence in Nebula Graph's future."
